<h1>Water Tank Quality Monitoring System</h1>
	<p>This project is aimed at detecting algae and other forms of contamination in water tanks. The system is designed to be cost-effective, easy to install and operate, and highly accurate in identifying the presence of algae and other contaminants.</p>
	<h2>Project Overview</h2>
	<p>Water tanks are an essential part of our daily lives, providing clean water for drinking, cooking, and other household activities. However, over time, these tanks can become contaminated with algae and other forms of bacteria, which can lead to health problems if not detected and treated promptly.</p>
	<p>The Water Tank Contamination Detection System uses computer vision and machine learning algorithms to detect the presence of algae and other contaminants in water tanks. The system consists of a camera that is mounted inside the tank and connected to a Raspberry Pi computer. The Raspberry Pi runs an image processing algorithm that analyzes the images captured by the camera and identifies any signs of contamination.</p>
	<p>The system is designed to send an alert to the user when contamination is detected, allowing for prompt action to be taken to clean the tank and prevent health problems.</p>
	<h2>Key Features</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>Low-cost and easy to install</li>
		<li>Highly accurate in detecting algae and other forms of contamination</li>
		<li>Sends alerts to users when contamination is detected</li>
		<li>Runs on a Raspberry Pi computer</li>
		<li>Uses computer vision and machine learning algorithms to analyze images</li>
	</ul>
	<h2>Installation</h2>
	<ol>
		<li>Set up a Raspberry Pi computer and install the required software.</li>
		<li>Connect the camera to the Raspberry Pi.</li>
		<li>Mount the camera inside the water tank.</li>
		<li>Configure the system settings and run the software.</li>
	</ol>
	<p>Once the system is set up, it will start capturing images of the inside of the water tank and analyzing them for signs of contamination.</p>
	<h2>Conclusion</h2>
	<p>The Water Tank Contamination Detection System is a cost-effective and highly accurate solution for detecting algae and other forms of contamination in water tanks. With its easy installation and user-friendly interface, it is an ideal solution for homeowners and small businesses looking to ensure the quality of their water supply.</p>
